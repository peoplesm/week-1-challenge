# Refactoring of Horiseon's Web Page

Horiseon's web site was in a functioning state but the code needed refactoring to help meet accessability standards and be better optimized for search engines.

## Changes to codebase to follow accessibility standards

- Changed <divs> tags to proper symantic structure such as <section> and <nav>
  - This allows the elements to follow a more logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Consolidated many class's to reduce unneeded reduncdancy in the css file
- Added alt tags to images
- Added titles to links and hero image
- Added comments to HTML and CSS files to allow for quick interpretation of what parts of the code are directed toward.
